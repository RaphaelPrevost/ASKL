 * Only one upgrader at a time may claim the lock. If multiple readers attempt
 * to upgrade concurrently, unsuccessful claimants temporarily cooperate by
 * dropping and later re-acquiring their read share so the current upgrader
 * can become the sole owner and transition the lock to write mode.
 *
 * On success, the caller no longer holds a read lock; it now owns the lock in
 * a special write mode and must eventually release it with @ref lock_restore().
 *
 * On failure (return value -1), the caller must assume that it no longer
 * owns a valid lock, neither for reading nor for writing. This usually

 * their critical sections cleanly.
