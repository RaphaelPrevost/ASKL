/**
 * @ingroup rwlock
 * @struct RW_Lock
 *
 * An internal read/write lock which provides:
 * - A fast uncontended path via atomic operations on @ref state.
 * - Blocking/wakeup for contended paths via @ref mutex and @ref cond.
 * - Support for upgrading a read lock to a write lock via @ref lock_upgrade()
 *   with a single "claimant" at a time and cooperative help from other readers.
 * - The ability to "break" the lock when destroying a map so that threads
 *   blocked in map operations wake up and fail cleanly instead of deadlocking
 *   on freed memory.
 *
 * The lock uses a single integer @ref state plus a mutex/condition pair.
 * The low bit of @ref state (0x1) is used as an "upgrade in progress" flag,
 * while the higher bits encode the base lock state and the number of readers.
 *
 * The following symbolic values are used:
 *
 * - @c -1        : broken; further calls to lock_rdlock(), lock_wrlock()
 *                  or lock_upgrade() will fail and return -1.
 * - @c WRLOCKED  (0) : write-locked; exactly one writer holds the lock.
 * - @c UPGRADED  (1) : upgraded; a single thread holds what was previously
 *                      a read lock but has transitioned to exclusive mode.
 * - @c UNLOCKED  (2) : no active readers or writers.
 * - @c RDLOCKED  (4) : base value for the "one reader, no claimant" state.
 *
 * For @ref state >= RDLOCKED the value is interpreted as:
 *
 * - Even (@c state & 0x1 == 0):
 *     the lock is held in read mode with no upgrade claim. The number of
 *     readers is (@c state - @c RDLOCKED) / @c LOCKSTEP + 1.
 *
 * - Odd (@c state & 0x1 == 1):
 *     an upgrade claim is in progress. One of the readers has set the
 *     claim flag and is attempting to become a writer.
 *
 * The special value @c CLAIMANT (5) denotes "exactly one reader remains and
 * it is the thread that has claimed the upgrade". At that point the upgrader
 * can atomically transition the lock from @c CLAIMANT to @c UPGRADED.
 *
 * On the fast path, readers and writers adjust @ref state atomically:
 *
 * - Readers increment @ref state by @c LOCKSTEP (2) as long as it is
 *   positive and even (no writer and no upgrade claim).
 * - Writers transition @ref state from @c UNLOCKED to @c WRLOCKED when no
 *   readers or claimers are present.
 * - Upgraders transition from @c RDLOCKED to @c UPGRADED when they are the
 *   only reader, or set the claim bit (by adding 1) when other readers are
 *   present and rely on them to cooperate.
 *
 * Cooperative readers that observe a claimed state with multiple readers
 * temporarily drop their read share (decrement @ref state by @c LOCKSTEP)
 * so that the upgrader can eventually become the sole remaining reader.
 *
 * On the slow path, @ref mutex and @ref cond are used to:
 *
 * - put readers and writers to sleep when they cannot adjust @ref state
 *   immediately, and
 * - wake them when the lock is released or broken.
 *
 * In builds without atomics, the same invariants are preserved, but all
 * updates to @ref state are performed under @ref mutex instead of using
 * atomic operations.
