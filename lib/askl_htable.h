 *
 * A Map is a hash-indexed associative container mapping arbitrary byte-string
 * keys to @ref variant values. In addition to O(1) expected-time lookups, it
 * maintains a stable internal index so that entries can be visited in a
 * well-defined order (e.g. insertion order or user-specified sort order).
 *
 * The map is safe for concurrent access: readers and writers are synchronized
 * internally using a read–write lock. Simple operations such as @ref map_get(),
 * @ref map_set() or @ref map_remove() may be used directly from multiple
 * threads without additional external locking.
 *
 * Instances of this type are created with @ref map_alloc() and must be
 * destroyed with @ref map_free() when no longer needed. All interaction with
 * the map should go through the functions declared in this header; the
 * structure layout is intentionally hidden and may change between releases.

/**
 * @ingroup map
 * @struct Map_Iterator
 *
 * This structure represents an iterator over the entries of a @ref Map.
 *
 * Iterators are created by @ref map_each() or @ref map_at().
 * They carry a reference to the underlying map and expose the current
 * key/value pair through their public fields.
 *
 * The iterator maintains a read lock on @ref map for the duration of its
 * lifetime. The lock is acquired when the iterator is created and is released
 * when the iterator is exhausted (via @ref map_next()) or explicitly
 * destroyed with @ref map_break().
 *
 * @b public @ref map      points to the map being traversed.
 * @b public @ref key      points to the current key bytes (NUL-terminated).
 * @b public @ref len      is the length of the current key in bytes
 *                         (excluding the terminating NUL).
 * @b public @ref val      is the current value associated with @ref key.
 *
 * @b private @ref _current is the internal cursor used to walk the map’s
 *                          index list. It must not be accessed directly by
 *                          user code.
 *
 * Iteration is performed by repeatedly calling @ref map_next() until it
 * returns NULL. The current entry may be updated or removed in-place using
 * @ref map_set_at() and @ref map_remove_at(), which perform the necessary
 * lock upgrades internally.
 *
 * @note The iterator itself is heap-allocated and is freed automatically when

 *  - @p value0, @p value1: associated values.
 *

 * contain embedded NUL bytes. Comparators should use @p len0 and @p len1
 * rather than treating keys as C strings.

 *  - zero if they are considered equal for ordering purposes,
 *  - a positive value if (key0, value0) should come after (key1, value1).
 *
 * The @p order argument controls whether the resulting order is ascending
 * (@ref MAP_ASC) or descending (@ref MAP_DESC) with respect to @p cmp.
 *
 * By default, sorting is persistent. After a successful call without
 * @ref MAP_SORT_ONCE, @p cmp and @p order become the map's active traversal
 * ordering policy. Later insertions or updates mark the index stale;
 * @ref map_foreach(), @ref map_each(), and @ref map_at() will lazily re-sort
 * the index before traversal when needed.
 *
 * If @ref MAP_SORT_ONCE is OR'ed into @p order, the index is sorted
 * immediately using @p cmp, but @p cmp and @p order are not installed as the
